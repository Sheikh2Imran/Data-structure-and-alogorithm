"""
Applications of Breadth First Traversal:
1. Peer to Peer Networks like bitTorrent.
2. Crawlers in Search Engines.
3. Social Networking Websites.
4. Breadth First Search is used to find all neighboring locations.
5.  Broadcasting in Network.
6. copying garbage collection using Cheneyâ€™s algorithm.
7. We can either use Breadth First or Depth First Traversal to find if there is a path between two vertices.
